          <h3>I have been making since I could walk</h3>
          <p>My mom used to call me her little MacGyver, Mac for short. It started with Legos, continued with rebuilding a lawn mower engine at the age of 8, and has evolved into Arduino-based projects like the internet controlled treat machine I built for my dog Chewie. Although the complexity of my projects has increased over the years, at the end of the day, it's all the same; I make because I love it.  I want to share my passion for making with the world.</p>

          <p><a href="https://github.com/jennykortina/Treat-Chewie" target="_blank">Treat Chewie</a> allowed users to facetime with my dog Chewie and give her a treat. "The call is actually triggered at the same time as a modified dog treat-dispensing gumball machine, both of which are attached to a Mac mini doubling as a server for the website. Through a combination of Arduino, AppleScript and Python, the system dispenses treats, calling Chewie to the camera, and then calls numbers collected from the website." -- <a href="https://gigaom.com/2011/11/30/sign-up-online-to-get-a-facetime-call-from-a-dog/" target="_blank">Giga Om Article</a></p>

          <p><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1794056" target="_blank">Thunderclip</a> was created when the iPhone switched from the traditional dock to the lightning adapter. This idea was prototyped and 3D printed at home on a Makerbot while being modeled in Google Sketchup. The video was created to submit the project to the now defunct Quirky, unfortunately the Thunderclip did not receive the blessing to be moved to production. RIP Thunderclip.</p>
